Notes:
This is a set of starter and reference files for the [NodeJS: Clients and Servers] video

Notes for Students:
1. This is more conceptual, low level network engineering is way out of scope for this course
2. The goal is to understand that:
  - Networking has a language agnostic set of standars: IP Adresses, Requests, Responses etc
  - NodeJS gives us the tools needed to build a server which would talk to a client
3. Experiment with a basic, barebones server. Don't worry you won't break anything!
