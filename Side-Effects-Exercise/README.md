Side Effects Exercise

The goal for this application is generate a star every 2.5 seconds, it generate a new star in a random position. With the power vested in my application, I will be able to click on these stars and destroy them.

## Component Design ðŸŽ¨

The application will consist of two main components, each dedicated to handling a distinct segment of the application's functionality. Here's a breakdown of the components you'll develop and their roles:

- `Space` represents the vast expanse of space. It is responsible for generating stars at random locations within its bounds every 2.5 seconds and manages the lifecycle of these stars.
- `Star` represents individual stars that are randomly placed in space. These components need to be focusable and destructible upon user interaction.
