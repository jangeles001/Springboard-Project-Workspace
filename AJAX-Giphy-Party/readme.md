**Some hints for the Assignment**

GIPHY has an extensive API with many endpoints, their extensive documentation can be found here:

https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide

Do note that there is a chance <api_key> value may need to be reset. This <api_key> is provided by the GIPHY API and their service may at any point reset or revoke it.
It is simple and free to get a new <api_key> and the steps are outlined in the quick start guide link above

Before you start, head over to the <index.js> file and explore the data which you're getting back. Use the above link for reference as well.

<br/>

1. Explore the API endpoints. When you use <axios> to request the following endpoint:

```js
async function giphyRequest() {
  const response = await axios.get(
    `http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/trending?api_key=MhAodEJIJxQMxW9XqxKjyXfNYdLoOIym`
  );
  console.log(response);
}
giphyRequest();
```

Take some time to note the following:

- What is the "shape" of the <data> returned by the <axios> request
  The shape of the response data is as follows:
  data: GIF Object[] //Gif information
  pagination: Pagination Object //Page information if multiple results are returned
  meta: Meta Object //Meta information for the gif

- Play around with the object and see what properties you can access
- What is the value and 'data type' of accessing <response.status>?
  The 'data type' of <response.status> is a nuber;

- What is the value and 'data type' of accessing <response.data> ?
  The 'data type' of <response.data> is an object;

- What is the value and 'data type' of accessing <response.data.data> ?
  The 'data type' of <response.data.data> is an object;

- What is the value and 'data type' of accessing <response.data.data[0]> ?
  The value of <response.data> is all the gif properties and it's 'data type' is an object.

Take time to explore the data as well

- What is the value of <response.data.data.length> ?
  The value of <response.data.data.length> is 50;

- What is the value and 'data type' of accessing <response.data.data[0].images> ?
  The value of <response.data.data[0].images> is a list of all the different gif versions and their
  corresponding objects containing thier properties. The 'data type' is an object. (ex. downsized_small: {height: '220', width: '238', size: '1955219', url: 'https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTQ4MjI3N2Myâ€¦W5nJmN0PWc/TdjIsPM7x0IK6KXLfd/giphy-downsized.gif'})

- What is the value and 'data type' of accessing <response.data.data[0].rating> ?
  The value of <response.data.data[0].rating> is "g" and it's 'data type' is a string.

<br/>

2. What if we slightly alter the parameters to our API request:

```js
// NOTE THE FOLLOWING: //
// there is a new value <limit> after the <api_key> : limit=10 //
async function giphyRequest() {
  const response = await axios.get(
    `http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/trending?api_key=MhAodEJIJxQMxW9XqxKjyXfNYdLoOIym&limit=10`
  );
  console.log(response);
}
giphyRequest();
```

Take some time to note some changes:

- What is the value of <response.data.data.length> now ?
  The value of <response.data.data.length> is now 10.

Take some time to look over the linked quick start guide as well

<br/>

3. To be able to display the GIF, we need the URL to that specific GIF. In your <index.html> file you may want to create an <img> tag to play around with the response data and manualy (at least for now) set the GIF url.

For example: if we wanted the URL for the downsized GIF of the first GIF in our results:

- Access the APIs (as in the Example 2 above)
- Note the object in the browser console of <response.data.data[0].images.downsized>
- Note the <height> <size> <width> <url> properties
- Try setting this GIF url manualy in your <index.html> file within your <img> tag

<br/>

4. Next think about how you would apply all the previous concepts, including:

- HTML / CSS
- Javascript - functions, event listeners and working with objects and arrays
- APIs
- DOM manipulation

Using these concepts, we want the GIFs to show up dynamically in the DOM, we want to search for them based on a provided search query in an HTML form

The endpoint for this would be:

http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?api_key=<api_key>&q=<search_term>

Where the values for:

<api_key> is our GIPHY api key
<search_term> is the category we are searching for (example q=cartoons)

Good Luck!
