## Cosmic Encyclopedia ðŸŒŒ

In this exercise, I will practice routing in React by using `React Router v6` to navigate between the many wonders of space. ðŸ¤©

My primary goal is to develop a React application that showcases various celestial objects. Users will navigate through different "pages" dedicated to planets, stars, nebulae, and galaxies, learning fascinating facts about each.

## Component Design ðŸŽ¨

- `App` acts as the foundation of your application, orchestrating the main layout and integrating the router setup to manage navigation between components.
- `NavBar` provides the navigational structure for your application, offering links that allow users to smoothly transition between different sections.
- `HomePage` is the initial landing page that greets users, offering an introduction or overview of what the application offers.
- `ContentPage` represents a dynamic component responsible for displaying specific content based on user selection or navigation. This component adapts to show different information based on the current route parameters.
- `NavigateBackButton` is a utility component that enhances navigation by offering a straightforward method for users to return to previous pages.
